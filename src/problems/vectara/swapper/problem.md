# Swapper

We've been noticing some really indescribable issues lately... Our beautiful nation of Vectara is assembled in segments, with each house having a specific address. However, some of us have been waking up, with entire homes, buildings, and parks swapped with their neighbors. And now that we're all out of order, our bridges, they're just all wrong!

We need your help to swap everyone back to their original positions, and we need help fast! Things like these can't be left unattended for long, or we'll have a real mess on our hands.

## Input

The first line of input will be, _n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6)_, representing the amount of properties in a chained segment.
The next line of input will contain n space seperated integers, each representing a property.

```
7
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
```

## Output

Print the chain of properties after they have been swapped back to their original positions.

```
2 1 4 3 6 5 7
```
