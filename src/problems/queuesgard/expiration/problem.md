# Expiration

As per the natural law of Queuesgard, there is a queue for the life cycle process of our citizens... Assuming a set number of houses to live in, and that a person will not be born and enter the queue of life until a house is empty, your task is to help us calculate the total time required for all the citizens to... expire!

__The person at the front of the queue proceeds to a home as soon as it becomes free.__

## Input

The first line of input will consist of two space separated integers, n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), representing the number of people in the queue and the number of homes.
The next line of input will consist of n space separated integers each representing the time it will take each person in the queue to expire.
