# Elapsed

Time is a concept that is very important in our lives. We use it to measure the duration of events, to plan our day, and to keep track of our progress. We need help to find the minimum minutes that have elapsed between any two times in a series of times to help us plan our day better.

In this problem, you are given a series of 24-hour times in the format _HH:MM_ and you are required to find the minimum minutes that have elapsed between any two times in the series.

## Input

The input will contain a single integer, _n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10,000)_, which represents the number of times in the series. The next _n_ lines will contain a 24-hour time in the format _HH:MM_.

```
3
12:00
12:30
13:00
```

## Output

Print a single integer, _m_, which represents the minimum number of minutes that have elapsed between any two times in the series.

```
