# Merry Go Word

Theres a silly little game here in Lexica, called Merry Go Word. Its pretty simple, but a lot of fun, and I hope you find it fun too! Here's how it goes:

Given a word and a number, spin the word around that many times! By spinning the word around, you take each letter, and rotate it to the right by one, with the last letter going to the front. Its fun with small amounts, but gets pretty crazy pretty fast.

I just got fired from the Grand Hall, something about "downsizing?" Anyways, I got lots of time to play Merry Go Word. Don't get shocked when I hit you with 100,000 rotations!

## Input

Input will consist of two lines. The first line will be a word with length _n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20)_, and the second line a number _k (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000)_
