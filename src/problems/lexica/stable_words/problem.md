# Stable Words

Our buildings here are reinforced with the mightest of inscriptions: words. It is said that the more stable the word, the more stable the architecture it is inscribed on. We're not very superstitious people here, but the word thing, that has got to be for real.

What makes a stable word? Well what makes a stable bridge (other than words). Just like triangles are to geometry, palindromes are the stablest of words! Help us figure out the stability of a building based on its inscriptions.

## Input

The first line of input will be an integer, _n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100)_, which represents the number of words inscribed on a given building. The following _n_ lines will be a single word _(1 ≤ length ≤ 100)_ to test for its stability (palindrome validity)

## Output

Print the stability of the building, which is represented as a percentage (to two decimals, no leading zeroes) of palindromes to total words

66.67%
