# Uncover the secrets of Algorion...
After waking up in an open field, the world of Algorion is beholden to you. Taking in the beautifully rich planet around you, marveling at the marvelous cities peering over the horizons, you begin to feel as equally excited as you are terrified. What is this strange world? Who are these people? Surely these structures are not made by mere man.

As you begin to explore, you will soon recognize that beneath the grandeur of this world rests a plague of malice... The people here have been capable of accomplishing such great feats, but now, the profound vitality of the world and its people has faded. Unrest looms through the world, and monsters begin to rise to the opportunity for chaos. Something is amiss here, and despite being what appears to be the only human in this world, you are determined. Deep within you burns a fire, a passion, to help the people of this world, and discover where the vigorous life of this planet has gone.
