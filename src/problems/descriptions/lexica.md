# Lexica
The region of Lexica is one of curiosity and wonder. The first characteristic that points out is, well, characters. Perhaps over a hundred unique dialects appear throughout Lexica, whether it be through natural language or runes alongside architecture. This place is a hub for collaboration and community, and both word of mouth and written scripture are highly cherished. It is said that these runes are even magical, which could be argued by virtue of the stability runes placed alongside buildings with architectural practices you'd swear were unsafe.

The people of Lexica line themselves with - you guessed it - runic tattoos from various languages. As for which, you are unsure, but observe the feeling of many diaspora communities here which stem from the varying dialects displayed on their body. People in Lexica are naturally friendly, partially due to their desire to strike up a conversation.

As you traverse more of the city, though, you once again notice a disdain for the very thing that makes Lexica what it is. People are beginning to grow bored, tired, and lost. Without the passion of runes and language, Lexica would be nothing, and you feel a bitter shame thinking about what would happen if these people continued to fall into despair.
